## Split a string into bytes 

```{r}
bytes( "hello 🌍" )
```

## Split a utf-8 encoded string into unicode runes 

If you run it in a [crayon](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon) compatible terminal, for example 
a recent enough version of rstudio, the `print` method gives you a nicer output:

## Details about unicode and utf-8

utf-8 encoded strings are divided in a series of runes (aka unicode code points) from 
the [unicode table](https://unicode-table.com/en/), for example the rune 
for the lower case "h" is [U+0068](https://unicode-table.com/en/#0068). 

Each rune is encoded in a variable number of bytes, depending on how far it is in the
table, for example "h" (and all other ascii characters) only need one byte, but 
🌍 needs 4 bytes. 

utf-8 bytes are organised as follows: 
 - the first byte of a rune starts with as many 1 as the rune needs bytes, followed by a 0, e.g. the first rune 
   for the utf-8 encoded 🌍 starts with "11110", and the only byte of the encoded "h" starts with "0"
 - the remaining bytes (if any) all start with "10"
 
All the bits that are not taken are used to store the binary representation of the rune, 
for example the 7 bits "1101000" follow the initial "0" in the encoding of "h". 🌍 correspond to the rune [U+1F30D](https://unicode-table.com/en/#1F30D), i.e. the rune number `0x1F30D`. 

```{r}
world_decimal <- strtoi( "0x1F30D", base = 16)
world_decimal

world_binary    <- paste( substr(as.character( rev(intToBits(world_decimal)) ), 2, 2 ), collapse = "" )
world_binary

world_binary_signif <- sub( "^0+", "", world_binary )
world_binary_signif

nchar(world_binary_signif)
```

So 🌍 needs `r nchar(world_binary_signif)` bits, which needs 4 utf-8 bytes.
